# Contributing to the CLI
### Setting up your environment
* Make sure you are using go1.8 (`go version`).
* Copy the source code (`go get github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli`).

### Building
From `$GOPATH/src/github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli`:
* Run `make` (This creates a standalone executable in the `bin/local` directory).

From `$GOPATH/src/github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli/ecs-cli`:
* run `dep ensure`. This will download dependencies specified in the `Gopkg.lock` by default in `$GOPATH/pkg/dep/sources`.
* **NOTE:** `dep ensure` puts the dependencies in a detached HEAD state.

### Adding/updating new dependencies
* We use [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) to manage dependencies. Make sure you have the latest [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) (installation instructions [here](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/installation.html)).
* To [add a dependency](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/daily-dep.html#adding-a-new-dependency), run `dep ensure -add <your_package>`.
* To [update a dependency](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/daily-dep.html#updating-dependencies), run `dep ensure -update<your_package>`.

### Generating mocks/licenses
* From `$GOPATH/src/github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli/`, run `make generate`. This
  will look for all files named `generate_mock.go` in the `ecs-cli/modules`
directory and call the `scripts/mockgen.sh` script, which is a wrapper for the
[mockgen](https://github.com/golang/mock#running-mockgen) command.
* **NOTE:** `make generate` will also regenerate the license via `scripts/license.sh`.

### Cross-compiling
The `make docker-build` target builds standalone amd64 executables for
Darwin and Linux. The output will be in `bin/darwin-amd64` and `bin/linux-amd64`,
respectively.

If you have set up the appropriate bootstrap environments, you may also directly
run the `make supported-platforms` target to create standalone amd64 executables
for the Darwin and Linux platforms.

### Testing
* To run unit tests, run `make test` from `$GOPATH/src/github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli`.

### Licensing
The Amazon ECS CLI is released under an [Apache 2.0](http://aws.amazon.com/apache-2-0/) license. Any code you submit will be released under that license.

For significant changes, we may ask you to sign a [Contributor License Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement).
