//* ----------------- COMPOSE PROJECT with ECS Service ----------------- */
// Note: A project is scoped to a single compose yaml with multiple containers defined
// and today, 1 compose.yml has 1:1 mapping with a task definition and a ECS Service.
// TODO: Split single compose to disjoint task definitions, so they can be run/scaled independently
//
// ---- LIFECYCLE ----
// Create and Start a project with service:
//   ecs-cli compose service create      : creates ECS.CreateTaskDefinition or gets from FS cache and ECS.CreateService with desiredCount=0
//   ecs-cli compose service start       : invokes ECS.UpdateService with desiredCount=1
//   ecs-cli compose service up          : compose service create ; compose service start. If the compose yml was changed, it updates the service with new task definition
// List containers in or view details of the project:
//   ecs-cli compose service ps          : calls ECS.ListTasks of this service
// Modify containers
//   ecs-cli compose service scale       : calls ECS.UpdateService with new count
// Stop and delete the project
//   ecs-cli compose service stop        : calls ECS.UpdateService with count=0
//   ecs-cli compose service down        : calls ECS.DeleteService
