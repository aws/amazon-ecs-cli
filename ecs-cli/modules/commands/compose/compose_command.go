// Create and Start a project:
//   ecs-cli compose create      : creates ECS.TaskDefinition or gets from FS cache
//   ecs-cli compose start       : invokes ECS.RunTask if count(running tasks) == 0
//   ecs-cli compose up          : compose create ; compose start and does a deployment of new compose yml if changes were found
//
// List containers in or view details of the project:
//   ecs-cli compose ps          : calls ECS.ListTasks (running and stopped) filtered with Task group: this project
//
// Modify containers
//   ecs-cli compose scale       : calls ECS.RunTask/StopTask based on the count
//   ecs-cli compose run         : calls ECS.RunTask with overrides
//
// Stop and delete the project
//   ecs-cli compose stop        : calls ECS.StopTask and ECS deletes them (rm)
